# üöÄ Alpaca Momentum Trading Bot

This project is an **automated stock trading bot** that uses **momentum-based strategies** to identify intraday movers and execute trades via the **Alpaca Paper Trading API**.

The bot continuously scans the market for strong gainers, applies **technical indicators** (VWAP, RSI, 10-bar breakout), and places **buy/sell orders** when conditions are met. It also manages risk with **cooldown periods** and **partial/full sell rules**.
